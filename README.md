# To-Do List App

A simple To-Do List app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This app allows users to add, remove, and toggle the completion status of to-do list items. The app uses local storage to store the to-do list items, so they persist even after the user closes the app.

## Features

* Add new to-do list items
* Remove to-do list items
* Toggle the completion status of to-do list items
* Local storage for persistent data

## Files

* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app
* `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the app
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the app

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the app
2. Add new to-do list items by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button
3. Remove to-do list items by clicking the "Delete" button next to each item
4. Toggle the completion status of to-do list items by clicking on the item itself

## Notes

* This app uses local storage to store the to-do list items, so they will persist even after the user closes the app.
* The app does not have any server-side functionality, so it can be run entirely in a web browser.
